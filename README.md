# libftd2xx-ffi

Rust FFI bindings to the [FTDI D2XX drivers].

This crate is **just** the C bindings.
There is a separate crate, [libftd2xx], which provides safe wrappers around
the unsafe C bindings.

## Usage
Simply add this crate as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`.
The static library is distributed in this crate with permission from FTDI.
The default feature set will use dynamic linking.

```toml
[dependencies]
libftd2xx-ffi = "~0.8.6"
```

### Bindgen
The default feature set will use pre-generated bindings.
This is only available for Windows x86_64 and Linux x86_64 platforms.

The bindings can also be generated during compilation using the [bindgen]
feature flag.
```toml
[dependencies]
libftd2xx-ffi = { version = "~0.8.6", features = ["bindgen"] }
```

Bindgen has additional dependencies that must be installed in order to
compile successfully, see the [bindgen requirements] page for more details.

### Static Linking
Static linking the FTD2XX library into this crate can be done by using
the static feature flag.
```toml
[dependencies]
libftd2xx-ffi = { version = "~0.8.6", features = ["static"] }
```
Static linking may be preferred, however there may be license
incompatibilities (static linking with GPL code).
If in doubt, check the FTDI [driver license terms].

## License
FTDI provides the D2XX driver as a compiled library and a header file.
These files can be found within the `vendor` directory.

The code within the `vendor` directory is licensed by FTDI.
Please see the [driver license terms] page for their license.

All code outside of the `vendor` directory is MIT licensed.

**Note:** This crate is not affiliated with FTDI.
You will need to contact the vendor for any support requests with the
underlying library because it is closed source.
