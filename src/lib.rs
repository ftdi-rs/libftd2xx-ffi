//! Rust FFI bindings to the [FTDI D2XX drivers].
//!
//! This crate is **just** the C bindings.
//! There is a separate crate, [libftd2xx], which provides safe wrappers around
//! the unsafe C bindings.
//!
//! # Usage
//! Simply add this crate as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`.
//! The static library is distributed in this crate with permission from FTDI.
//! The default feature set will use dynamic linking.
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! libftd2xx-ffi = "~0.7.0"
//! ```
//!
//! ## Bindgen
//! The default feature set will use pre-generated bindings.
//! This is only available for Windows x86_64 and Linux x86_64 platforms.
//!
//! The bindings can also be generated during compilation using the [bindgen]
//! feature flag.
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! libftd2xx-ffi = { version = "~0.7.0", features = ["bindgen"] }
//! ```
//!
//! Bindgen has additional dependencies that must be installed in order to
//! compile successfully, see the [bindgen requirements] page for more details.
//!
//! ## Static Linking
//! Static linking the FTD2XX library into this crate can be done by using
//! the static feature flag.
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! libftd2xx-ffi = { version = "~0.7.0", features = ["static"] }
//! ```
//! For GNU/Linux users, no further work is needed.
//! Technically this may be preferred, however there may be license
//! incompatibilities (static linking with GPL code).
//! If in doubt, check the FTDI [driver license terms].
//!
//! On Windows, we rely on MSVC and a manually set "LIBMSVC_PATH" environment
//! variable.
//! For example a possible 2019 Community installation path may be:
//! ```text
//! C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.28.29333\lib\
//! ```
//! This brings in `legacy_stdio_definitions.lib` and `user32.lib`.
//! It seems to play nicely with rust, but you may end up with multiple defined
//! symbol errors if using this crate as a c/c++ dependency.
//!
