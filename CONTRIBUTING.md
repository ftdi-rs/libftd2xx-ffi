## Pre-generated Bindings
The pre-generated bindings are generated by compiling this crate,
then copying the `bindings.rs` file from the build output.

The Windows bindings were run through `dos2unix` to normalize line endings
and make it easier to diff the generated bindings.

## Mac OSX

Mac files are distributed from the vendor as `.dmg` files, these can be
extracted on linux with `apfs-fuse`, for example

```bash
sudo ./apfs-fuse -o uid="$(id -u)",gid="$(id -g)",allow_other D2XX1.4.16.dmg d2xx  
```

Mac bindings can be generated cross-platform with:
```bash
bindgen --allowlist-function 'FT_.*' --allowlist-type 'FT_.*' --allowlist-var 'FT_.*' --rustfmt-bindings vendor/macos/ftd2xx.h > src/bindings_macos_x64.rs
```
